# ‚ö° Cross-Site Scripting (XSS, Reflected) ‚Äì DVWA

## üîç Objective
Exploit **Reflected XSS** vulnerability to execute JavaScript code in the victim‚Äôs browser.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Steps Taken

1. **Testing Input**
   - Chose *XSS (Reflected)* module in DVWA.
   - Entered payload:
     ```html
     <script>alert('XSS')</script>
     ```
   - Browser executed ‚Üí Alert pop-up confirmed vulnerability.

2. **Refined Payload**
   - Used payload:
     ```html
     <img src=x onerror=alert("XSS_Demo_Triggered")>
     ```
   - Works without `<script>` tag ‚Üí Bypasses basic filters.

3. **Automation with Python**
   - Created `xss_reflected.py`
   - Script:
     - Sends payload via `GET` parameter
     - Checks if payload is reflected in server response
     - Confirms injection

4. **Proof**
   - Browser pop-up alert triggered
   - Script detected reflected payload in HTML response

---

## üì∏ Proof
- Screenshot: Alert pop-up (`XSS_Demo_Triggered`)
- Screenshot: Python script detecting reflected payload

---

## ‚úÖ Result
Successfully exploited **Reflected XSS**:
- Injected payload executed in browser
- Vulnerability confirmed both **manually** and **via automation**
